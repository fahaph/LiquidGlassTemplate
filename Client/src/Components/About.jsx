                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                  We believe that a thoughtful gift should capture a moment and
                  preserve it forever. That's why we started Valentiny for You. <br/><br/>

                  Tired of giving beautiful, yet temporary, fresh flowers that
                  wilted within a week, we sought a better solution: the Soap
                  Flower. Each bloom we create is a piece of art, meticulously
                  handcrafted to rival the beauty of a real rose, but designed
                  to last a lifetime. <br/><br/>
                  
                  Our mission is simple: to help you express
                  love, gratitude, and remembrance with a gift that is as
                  enduring as your feelings. When you choose a bouquet from us,
                  you're not just buying flowers; you're investing in a
                  long-lasting memory and a beautiful piece of d√©cor that can be
                  cherished for years. <br/><br/>
                  
                  Thank you for letting us be a part of
                  your special moments.
